abstract: |
  Synthetic assets are collateral-backed assets whose value fluctuates depending on a reference price. We propose a scheme where anyone can lock collateral on the Liquid Network to issue assets that track the price of a chosen real-world asset, such as dollars or stocks. The Elements enhanced scripting capabilities allow non-interactive redemption and liquidation when the collateral's value is underwater, with the possibility to top up the collateral to prevent liquidation.
